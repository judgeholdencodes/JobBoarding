Phase 1: Planning and Design (Weeks 1-2)

1.  Detailed Requirement Gathering and Specification:
     User Stories: Define user stories for both employers and job seekers. Examples:
         "As an employer, I want to be able to post a job listing with details like title, description, location, salary, and required skills."
         "As a job seeker, I want to be able to create a profile with my skills, experience, and education."
         "As a job seeker, I want to be able to search for jobs based on keywords, location, job type, and experience level."
     Feature Breakdown: List all the features mentioned in the description and any additional ones you might want to include initially or in future iterations.
     Technical Design Decisions:
         Confirm the chosen technologies (React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, LinkedIn API, WebSocket).
         Plan the overall architecture (e.g., separate front-end and back-end servers).
         Outline the database schema for users, job listings, applications, etc.
         Plan the API endpoints needed for communication between the front-end and back-end.
     UI/UX Design (Wireframing and Mockups):
         Create low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the layout of key pages (job listings, user profiles, search results, application forms).
         Develop high-fidelity mockups using tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to define the visual design and user flow.

2.  Project Setup:
     Version Control: Set up a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
     Project Structure: Create the basic folder structure for your front-end and back-end projects.
     Initial Back-end Setup: Initialize your Node.js project using `npm init -y` and install essential dependencies like `express`, `body-parser`, `cors`.
     Initial Front-end Setup: Create your React application using Create React App (`npx create-react-app job-board-frontend`) or a similar setup.

Phase 2: Back-end Development (Weeks 3-6)

3.  Database Setup (MongoDB):
     Install and configure MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
     Design and implement the database schemas for:
         Users: (employer/job seeker roles, authentication details, profile information)
         Job Listings: (title, description, company, location, salary, job type, experience level, skills, posting date)
         Applications: (job seeker ID, job listing ID, application date, resume URL/data, status)

4.  API Development (Node.js/Express):
     User Authentication: Implement routes for user registration, login, and logout using libraries like `bcrypt` for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for creating and verifying tokens.
     Job Listing Management:
         Create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for employers to manage their job listings.
         Implement validation for job posting data.
     User Profile Management:
         Develop API endpoints for job seekers to create, read, update, and potentially delete their profiles.
         Handle resume uploads (consider using libraries like `multer`).
     Application Management:
         Create API endpoints for job seekers to apply for jobs.
         Implement logic to store application data in the database.
         Potentially create endpoints for employers to view applications for their listings.

5.  Search Functionality (Elasticsearch):
     Install and configure Elasticsearch.
     Integrate Elasticsearch with your Node.js back-end.
     Implement indexing of job listings in Elasticsearch whenever a new job is posted or updated.
     Develop API endpoints that query Elasticsearch based on search criteria (keywords, location, job type, experience level).

Phase 3: Front-end Development (Weeks 7-10)

6.  Basic UI Structure and Routing (React):
     Set up the basic layout and navigation using React Router.
     Create core components for:
         Homepage (displaying featured/recent jobs)
         Job Listings Page (displaying search results)
         Job Detail Page
         User Registration and Login Forms
         Job Seeker Profile Page
         Employer Dashboard (for managing listings)
         Application Form

7.  Component Development and State Management (React):
     Build reusable UI components for displaying job cards, form inputs, buttons, etc.
     Implement state management using React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, or a more advanced library like Redux or Context API for managing application-wide state.

8.  API Integration (Front-end):
     Use `fetch` or a library like Axios to make API calls to your Node.js back-end for:
         Fetching job listings based on search criteria.
         Submitting applications.
         Creating and updating user profiles.
         Handling user authentication.

9.  Advanced Search Filters (React):
     Implement UI elements for filtering jobs by location, job type, experience level, etc.
     Update API calls based on the selected filters to fetch relevant job listings.

10. User Authentication (Front-end):
     Handle user login and registration forms.
     Store authentication tokens (e.g., in local storage or cookies) and manage user sessions.
     Implement protected routes that require authentication.

11. LinkedIn API Integration (Front-end):
     Register your application with LinkedIn Developer Platform.
     Obtain the necessary API keys and access tokens.
     Implement functionality to allow users to import data from their LinkedIn profiles to pre-fill their job seeker profiles. This typically involves using OAuth 2.0 for authentication and making API calls to retrieve profile information.

Phase 4: Real-time Notifications and Refinements (Weeks 11-12)

12. Real-time Notifications (WebSocket):
     Integrate a WebSocket library (e.g., `ws` for Node.js and `socket.io-client` for React).
     Implement back-end logic to emit notifications for events like:
         New job postings matching a job seeker's saved searches.
         Updates on application status.
     Develop front-end components to receive and display these real-time notifications.

13. UI/UX Enhancements and Testing:
     Refine the user interface based on feedback and best practices.
     Conduct thorough testing of all features, including:
         Unit testing for individual components and functions.
         Integration testing to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.
         End-to-end testing to simulate user interactions.
     Address any bugs or usability issues found during testing.

Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation (Week 13)

14. Deployment:
     Deploy your back-end application to a hosting platform like Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.
     Build your React front-end for production and deploy it using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or a static site hosting service on AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
     Ensure your database (MongoDB) and search engine (Elasticsearch) are also accessible in the production environment.

15. Documentation:
     Write clear and concise documentation for your project, including:
         Setup instructions for local development.
         API documentation (using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI).
         Database schema details.
         Explanation of key architectural decisions.

Ongoing Considerations:

 Security: Implement security best practices throughout the development process, including input validation, protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection (though less relevant for NoSQL), secure password handling, and protection of API keys.
 Scalability: Consider potential scalability challenges early on, especially for the database and search functionality.
 Performance Optimization: Optimize your front-end code for speed and responsiveness. Optimize database queries and Elasticsearch queries for efficient data retrieval.
 Accessibility: Design and develop your application with accessibility in mind (WCAG guidelines).
 Error Handling: Implement robust error handling on both the front-end and back-end to provide a better user experience.
 Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Consider setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
